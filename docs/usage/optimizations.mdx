# Optimizations (BETA)

> (BETA) Note that this feature may not be formally supported in future versions.

By default, `ReactWordcloud` uses the [`d3.cloud`](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud) layout algorithm. The algorithm as of [v1.2.5](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud/releases/tag/v1.2.5) is not optimized to handle rendering of larger dataset of words.

An optimized solution was explored by [WhoAteDaCake](https://github.com/WhoAteDaCake) in [#33](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/react-wordcloud/pull/33), and can be accessed by setting `options.enableOptimizations` to `true`. This feature is marked as a beta due to a lack of formal support, and it will be more fully supported when `d3.cloud` applies the relevant optimizations.

This section shows how multiple wordclouds are rendered with `enableOptimizations` set to `true`.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  {Array.from(Array(10).keys()).map(key => (
    <div key={key} style={{ height: 400, width: 300 }}>
      <ReactWordcloud options={{ enableOptimizations: true }} words={words} />
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
